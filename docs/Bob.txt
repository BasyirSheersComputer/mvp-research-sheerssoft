Meeting with Bob - GM turnarounds for Trinidad and many other hotels

Part 1: Framing & Rapport (2 Minutes)
"Bob, thank you for jumping on. We are on a quest to understand the 'absolute reality' of hotel operations. You’ve done the hard yards—pre-openings, conversions, and managing lifestyle brands like lyf. We want to build something that solves the actual 'bleeding' that happens during a launch, rather than just adding more noise to a GM’s dashboard."



Background:
Preopening - 1 year period - just done now on leave - just get it running first then a lot of troubleshooting - a lot recalibration - inclusive for from green, brown, also conversions - firefighting



Part 2: Pre-Opening & Conversion "Bleed" (5 Minutes)
Goal: Quantify the pain of launching a property.

The Day 1 Failure: "In your recent pre-openings (like Trinidad or lyf), what was the one system—tech or manual—that caused the most 'firefighting' on opening week? What did that chaos cost the hotel in terms of man-hours or lost guest reviews?"



Response: Firefighting - effect - system readiness - 2 readiness -product/facility readiness & the system - cannot just sell - need both to be ready - system need to be concise - goes to website, booking channel, visibility and detail



The Conversion Friction: "When converting a repurposed building, the layout is often non-standard. Tell me about a time a guest got frustrated because they couldn't find information, and the staff was too busy to help. How much 'hidden' workload did that add to your Front Office team?"



DO happen - when do conversion Abrand to B brand - when sell need to be updated to B brand - iehtehr higher category  more luxury or soirt - have a grace period - soft oepning - trained staff

- the idea of having soft opening to the public makes it less strenues - sell at lower pricing - dont put the expectation as higha s when fully running - marketted as trial phase - can still see construction/touchup - guest can still accept

- introduction pricing -be part of the brand/experience that elevates the standard to the true brand - take footage with thir consent - these are the people when launch  call them back - true word of mouth - they talk about



The Inquiry Leakage: "During the 'buzz' of a pre-opening, leads come from everywhere—OTAs, LinkedIn, WhatsApp. Walk me through how your team captured those high-intent inquiries last time. How many do you estimate 'dropped off' simply because the response wasn't instant?"



Drop off leads - on expectation - cannot quantify in percentage - sometime it does -sometime it doesnt - usually go down maybe 5% - in case of managing expectation - in my experience rarely happen - if new property - much easier to handl as compared to takeover/conversion property

- upgrading from A to B and B brand have higher sticking price - if we communicate the value of B - they will be okay - taking from a local brand convert it to a well known international brand - usually itl brand have their own website/membership channel/locyallty program

- deliver brand promise they are okay



Part 3: The Decision Room & Procurement (5 Minutes)
Goal: Understand the "Who" and the "How" of buying.

The Power Map: "When you were setting up lyf or Trinidad, who was the person who actually initiated the search for new tech? Was it you as the GM, the corporate HQ (Ascott), or was the Owner pushing for a specific ROI?"



New tech - suply & infra - collective thing - lyf is more for digital nomad - don't go for luxury, go for convenience/more interaction - always look for tech - what works for the brand/market

- the lisbon melaka - lazy ppl wake up 12pm go for breakfast - no need interactive tv/digital interaction like digital nomad - they just want to sip whisky - prefer watch tv and relax instead

- not taht have tech but more focused on comfort level as compared to interactiveness



The Influencer: "In your experience, who is the 'silent killer' of a new tech project? Is it the IT manager worried about integration, or the Finance team worried about the monthly subscription?"



Silent killer - finance - no -always looking for efficiency - IT team is more killer - tech evolves very fast - strenueos to keep up - demand keep changing from both working team and guest

- by the time start something else the next 3 months changes again - no point doig this, they gonna change in the next 3 mths - the IT - for hotel line they think 1 IT person is enough for 200 hotel rooms

- support recoommended 3 for 200 rooms - sometime ppl dont know what IT does - if screen goes blank as calls IT



The Contract Journey: "Think of the last service contract you signed (maybe for facilities or software). From the first 'coffee chat' to the actual contract signing, how many months did it take? What was the one document or 'proof' they needed to see before saying yes?"



Period - could come an avg of 3-6 mths - something big/new would take longer - something available in the market would be okay 3 months - higher GM for preopening need to be in 6 months in - if  comes in later might not be able to capture how the systems working

- most document important for any preopening hotel - is the fire cert (Bomba cert) - training of the team - business can still open without the hotel signboard but still need Bomba cert - start 6 months to get it ready, 3 moths to do internal testing another 3 months to do schedule with Bomba - tehy will say when can open

- Bomba decides readiness - sometimes before conversion they dont ahve a fire cert - the difference between local and intl brand - if Bomba not approve even if the booking is done, need to send the guest to a siister hotel, cover the reservation cost

- usually we always ask them for SSM, Company background, also check CTOS & the contract later always has insurance coverage - lets say ur our operator - you need to have 3rd party insurance - on software contingency plan above all the insurance - CS/base service that is always available

- service backup for product/SW must have a 24 hrs respond team - when it comes to simple stuff related to laptop/connectivity will call IT - submit tender - above anything else should consider about the cost (money) - always take the product and look for comparisons

- the vendor sometime get frustrated - backtalk:cause the hotel take proposal to do comparison



Part 4: The "Food Fanatic" & F&B Logic (2 Minutes)
Goal: Validate Amsyar's F&B yield points with Bob's GM perspective.

F&B Blind Spots: "You’re a food fanatic and managed F&B at Sanofi. Why is it that hotels have great data for rooms (Opera) but almost zero 'interactive' data for F&B? What's the cost of a guest sitting in a ballroom and not knowing what the bar offers?"



Imagine - in a year how many hotels renovate their rooms - zero - hotel renovate their rooms every 5 years - every year they make sale - they put  a fund for renovation - as compared to F&B - F&B change menu every 3 mths - this year and next year is different menu

- can only compare changes on revenue - for Italian restaurant if a menu item doesnt work - remove it - that data is gone - cannot compare it anymore - on client data - there is not permanent supply - there is no database

- Opera etc - have the data of company address etc - have proper tracking - F&B may not have propertracking - except roomie? - might have statistics - not sure how good it does - roomie only use for room services not restaurant ordering by itself - which may be a good idea for tracking

- for trinidad - can only do comparison yoy - where rooms can do monthly, weekly, daily - food depends on mood, rooms depend on need - travel for business, leasuire, weddings - why do you have coffee in the lounge as compared to the bar



The "Hook": "If we were to package a solution for a GM in the pre-opening phase, what is the 'one metric' on the contract that makes it a no-brainer? (e.g., 'Recovering 10% of lost leads' or 'Reducing guest inquiry calls by 30%')."



Hook - impact on guest experience - 1 to 5 ranking - need to be at lvl 4.8 - needs to be a 95 of scoring - first 3 mths depends on company/brand - dont think much of cost - first 3 months a lot of cost - due to tests, trial run, food ttasting etc. - the cost of the hotel should come into magnifying glass after 6 mths of opening

-sales should be up by the 4th month, first 3 mths no expectation, 4th is break even 5th growth 3-5% - 6th month start to track - open in Jun 2025 run after 6 mth the actual of need to make money say by before Jan say Nov/Dec start doing forecast/budget expenses for 2026

- cause all the dry run, machine ahs been tested OTA, first 6 months need to upload actual product photo - preopening usually have not all the facilities running - online booking need actual photo - if using artist impression - will have lower visibility

- in order to upload in google - need to do stream ing - live walkabout -say this is lobby, etc - then they'll put you on actual google search - theyll put u on the map - takes time - during the period of soft opening - need ppl to take photos and upload and tagging

- if ppl are mentioning low about you on the internet  - they see no pt putting you on the map - search, keywords etc - say need 150 keyword searches for lisbon melaka you will not be listed - or if you pay - expensive

- thats why first trial period is very important - hiring staff is also improtant - for staff to take photo and tag

Part 5: Closing & The "Golden Question" (1 Minute)
The Referral: "Bob, this has been invaluable. We want to make sure we aren't building in a vacuum. Who is the most tech-frustrated GM or Owner in your network that we should talk to next to see the 'ugly' side of hotel tech?"



Have you make contact with SKS? - because they are also quite prominent - SKS hospitality led by Meera Raj (head of hospitality), my good friend - she also has a very wide experience of preopening, running hotels - stuff like that - they are coming up in Malaysia doing franchising, conversion, take over

- mention refer by Bob when contacting Meera

Bonus:
10. Benefit, challenges conversation, advantage vs disadvantage - its all comes down to relationship - how flexible are you in payment - how you stretch the payment - sometime the company is willing to pay 80k-100k but not right now - conversion/new project always overshoot budget

- as long as flexible should be okay - the mission is always on the product itself dulu - bukak the pintu dulu - if they get you in first they pay you maybe 1/3 as deposit first - then pay the rest with cash flow

- some company not - payment terms - its all about the money - preopening of hotel they want to have cashflow - cause its still troubleshooting for first 6 mths - will use the cashflow for monthly operation to keep it afloat

- say they already have 80k for system budget, they will give you 30k and keep 50k for construction - sometime the 50k can invest in promotion - tiktoker etc - walaupun ada bajet tu - slalunya dont want to use it up

- balance after 6 months put as working capital - set the right expectation - they wont pay you too much at one time - they dont understand if the system/software if it even works with the ir product/hotels
