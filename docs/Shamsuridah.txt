Service Standards & Team Workflow

Core Priorities: Focus on the speed and quality of service.

Response Times: A response time of 3–5 hours is currently considered normal.

Team Composition: Operations are handled by 3 sales staff and 2 coordinators who reply to inquiries on behalf of the team.

Workflow Gaps: A primary operational weakness identified is the systematic follow-up on inquiries.

CRM Usage: A CRM system is available, but it is not being utilized to its full potential; the process remains heavily dependent on human intervention.

Market Dynamics & Occupancy

General Performance:

Average monthly occupancy: Approximately 80%.

Year-end occupancy: Typically reaches 90%+.

No-Shows: Clarified that standard no-shows are typically 3–4 per day (not 20–30 daily), and these are usually from the corporate segment.

Pricing Strategy: Prepaid bookings remain the cheapest option.

Operational Demands: Because the hotel is in a "hot location," speed of service is critical for daily operations.

Rate Integrity & Best Rate Guarantee (BRG)

System Latency: Discrepancies often come from Accor HQ due to currency exchange fluctuations or latency in OTA rates.

Static Rate Limitations: Accor and Marriott have very limited static rate options for travel agents.

Only 6% is allocated for static rates.

These are for contracted agents only, not for wholesalers.

Reporting: Issues are escalated to Accor HQ; while sales are often not "lost," these instances cannot be claimed under BRG if they stem from external platform errors.


Demand & Channel Distribution

Segment Breakdown:

OTA (Public) + Website: Accounts for 60% of total demand.

Corporate: Accounts for 20%–25% of demand.

B2B: Primarily travel agents; notably, Accor does not allow static rates for this segment.

Booking Channels: Bookings come via the website, email, and phone calls.

Strategy: Accor is actively trying to eliminate phone calls in favor of 100% system-based bookings.

Reservations & Operations

Team Structure: 1 Reservations Manager, 1 Supervisor, and 1 Agent.

Email Management: The team handles approximately 100 emails daily.

70% of these are processed through the system automatically.

30% require manual checking and intervention.

Workload: On busy days (Wednesdays and Thursdays), the total volume of calls and emails can reach 200–300.

Staff Challenges: Managing the backlog on busy days can require an extra hour of work to keep operations manageable.

Rate Integrity & Performance

Rate Leakage: Metasearch sites are identifying lower rates elsewhere compared to the official website.

Identifying this leakage is considered a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for managers.

Best Rate Guarantee (BRG): Last month, there were 4 validated BRG claims through Accor.

Example Case: A room rate of RM 300 on the internal system was found on Agoda for RM 150.

No-Shows: During high-demand periods, the property sees only approximately 20–30 monthly no-shows.

Conversion: Conversion for phone calls (typically related to travel agent static rates) is above 90%.
