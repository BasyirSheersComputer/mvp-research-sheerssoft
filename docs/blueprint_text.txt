Guide: Kindly write your response below for each respective question. The more details the better 😁The Hospitality Revenue & Operational BlueprintObjective: To move beyond "dashboard" talk and uncover the absolute reality of operational friction, revenue leakage, and the procurement cycle in Malaysian Hotels.Module 1: The Operational "Bleed" & Quantifying the PainGoal: Identify the "Elephant in the Room"—pains so significant that the price of software becomes irrelevant.The Information Gap: You mentioned guests getting lost in car parks or not knowing "hotel ada apa" because systems are siloed. Tell me about a specific time a guest had a "very bad experience" due to this lack of info. How did it impact the front-desk workload that day?A standard hotel check in at the hotel front desk, takes between 3-5minutes.Reason being if the hotel has 20 rooms x  5min = 100 minutes.Some big hotels have an average of 300 – 500 rooms = 2500min.This scenario is based on sufficient fron desk staffing, no medical leave, no emergency leave etc.Guest checking in expect fast and efficient check in – based on pre reservations and request.Imagine guest first time coming to the hotel, and decides to seek further information regarding room, facilities etc. because there is insufficient information/interaction on the product.So when a guest check in and things are not right, that causes delay in customers check in, backlog of front desk work, and total disaster on customer experience. How can Ai improve this.The Failed Remedies: When a hotel realizes they are losing business due to "low manpower" or "high operating cost," what is the first thing they usually spend money on to fix it? Roughly how much was invested in that fix, and why did it fail to stop guests from "just not coming back"?The second biggest operating cost in hospitality services are normally ‘ Human Resourbes’. It’s a liability hiring sufficient and reliable man power. But when your business is based on seasonal, fluctuation, geographical sitautions etc.So the fastest cost cutting measures are to reduce manpower, as this normally constitutes as ‘ Vairable Cost’ that can be controlled. (A wrong definition made by owners).Hospitality is all about ‘experience’, and if you don’t have that ‘ Service Experience’.When they owners realize that business has taken a dip due to that -  finding and hiring right candidates canbe a very lengthy course and high cost, advertisement, job hunters etc.This creates an unsatisfactory situation for customers, and brand of the property drop’s as the word of mouth moves around about the owner and management stinging on hiring employees.The "Customer #4" Cost: Think of a recent case where a high-net-worth guest went silent after a service failure (like the "veg-option" turn-off). What is the estimated Lifetime Value (LTV) lost from that single guest? How recently did this happen?LTV – you will never get back that client these days’ as there are many competitors / options out there, they just ‘Silently’ move.Hospitality repeated business constitutes to almost 40% of total revenues.This is currently happening in 2025/26.The Training Wall: You noted that training costs hundreds of thousands. Walk me through the last time a team was "Hentam" over an audit/SOP issue. How many man-hours were lost to the subsequent retraining, and did the quality actually improve?We conducted an audit on and international brand and they scored 38% over and average passing score of 75%.This was due to the main ‘Managers’ who were initially hired and trained to lead the lines of duty according to SOP’s set up, resigned due to pressure of work.This followed through with juniors who were relatively comfortable working with that manager.Impact here is, the SOP’ were not re instructed, trained again with new hires. Reason being, owners though they can save costOwners thought everyone/everybody cand be just hired from the streets and do the job.A full review of the audit was carried out, and recommendation were given to the owners on the pros and cons.Re-hiring and training cost shot up by 27% against avg monthly revenues (estimated 3 to 6 months)Impacted revenue flow / operations consistencyStricter regulations on SOP adherenceKYC & Trust: Why do 5-star hotels still fail to remember a regular's birthday or history? Tell me about a time a guest refused to join a membership because of the "hassle of isi borang." How much "Retention Revenue" walked out the door with them?There are many CRM system’s / procedures out there, what is the 1 system that works efficiently, that people will remember and use that to generate information?You phone personal calendar (reminder) , hotel reservations system, etc.Unless you knoe the person personally, this gets recognized. Either that that, nobody cares these days.The interactiveness of staff, these days are not there, I have had instances, my wife wanted to surprise me with a birthday cake in our hotel room, guess what, front desk forgot to make arrangements. Thus until todal my wife remembers that incident (15 years ago).These days, and average of 15% business are lost due to brand damage etc.Module 2: The "Ferrari" Trap (System Inefficiency)Goal: Understand why $100k/year systems like Opera fail the staff.Manual Workarounds: Tell me about a task that Opera should handle, but the staff still does via WhatsApp, Excel, or by "asking the security." How many hours a week does a Manager spend managing these manual workarounds?Opera system failure often crumbles due to improperlt configured night audit processes, complex software vulnerabilities or integration breakdowns where data fails to sync with third-party vendors. Technical issues like slow loading, browser cache, or database locks during oeak times also cause operational failures.Example – credit card cannot be swiped or picked up on system upon check in, staff has to manually swipe the card -  then there is back officice documentation to call the card centre, verify the manual swipe, wait for the approval code, manually key into the opera, reconcillation with finance on this matter, as they don’t want later on – Police report, ‘My Card Was Swiped Manually’Manager normaly does an 8hrs shift, but due to this issues, and manual reporting, his hours may be dragges almost 15 to 18 hrs.The ROI Gap: For a system costing $100k/year, what is the #1 feature that is never used? What was the specific reason given during the last budget review for keeping the system despite this 5% utilization?Opera is supposed to be an integrated system for managing hotels , buy modules like sales & catering, vacation ownership, revenue management are not used daily by staffs.Some features don’t align with the hotels operating method, do they have the skilled workforce to manage systems like opera -  someone has to champion the syatem from respective departments, and if that employee resign, what happens?Some owners / operators, may decide to keep the system due to:-Brand requirement / affiliation of group managementHigh investment to re-invest vs maintainFeedback from employees if they change ( repercussion)The "Idiot-Proof" Search: You mentioned hotels are looking for "simplified systems at reasonable costs." In your recent boutique resort project in JB, what was the specific "must-have" feature that the US brands (like Hyatt) provide but local systems lack?Scalability & FlexibilityModular design allowing hotels to choose what and how they wantComprehensive FunctionalityStreamline operations and include F&BCloud Capabilities Modern user interface with real-time date access from anywhere – instead of running to the hotel to check computerExtensive IntegrationsCommects seamlessly with hundreds of third-party systemsImproved Efficiency & Data managementReduces staff workload with automated workflows and provides advanced reporting for better decision-making.Trusted Industry StandardConsidered ‘safe’ and highly reliable choice with robust reputation ( reviews) customers / operatorsModule 3: The Decision Room & Purchasing JourneyGoal: Map the repeatable path to a "Yes" and identify the Champion, Influencer, and Decider.The Last Tech Purchase: Walk me through the last time a hotel property you advised signed a contract for a new system.The Champion: Who originally brought the idea to the table?Through recommendation from the project consultants.The Influencer: Who was the most vocal "skeptic" (e.g., someone fearing they'd lose their "pocket money" transparency)?The project consultant – through the presentation deck(pros & cons)The Decider: Who actually signed the check, and what was the one sentence that convinced them?Through tender process – with the’ Pros & Cons’, durability, back up service (24/7), price, durability, ‘ REVIEWS & FEEDBACK’The Owner Factor: You mentioned Owners often interfere (YTL, Hong Leong, etc.). Tell me about a time an Owner blocked a tech purchase the GM desperately wanted. What was their stated reason? 11. The Evaluation Window: From the first "First Contact" to the final contract, how many months did it take? How many different people had to be "convinced" during that period?The GM wanted to invest into a new Banquet reservations system (integrated) – DelphiFrom start to procument – almost 6 monthsGM to finance on cost / availability of current inhouse funding or owners investment (capex)Owners presentation and discussion with the board for final approval ( most difficult part) / ROIThe Budget Cycle: Most hotels look at new tech during "broken system" moments. Is there a specific month (e.g., Oct/Nov) where the "Innovation/AI" budget is actually allocated, or is it always an ad-hoc CAPEX request?Most hotels start the annual budget preparation as early as July for the corresponding year. This process takes indepth study of the current business flow, actual revenues, rates, operating cost, increase in commodities  etc.Expansion plans, renivations, upgrade etc.By October normally the first draft is presented, taking into account the 4tq quarter revenues are forecasted on an 85% accuracy, to forecast the year’s performance.So then the hard part comes in, presenting and convincing the owners/stake holders on the Business Plan and changes versus cost, Pro’s & Con’s.Quotation of normally 3 to 5 vendors, depending on the complexity if the project.Ad- hoc capex, normally applies for emergency cases only.Module 4: Marketing & Engagement "Blind Spots"Goal: Understanding why hotels lose business to "silence."The Promotion Gap: When a property has "low engagement" or "no pickups," what is the manual process the Sales team currently does to try and fix it? How much time is spent on "Integrated Marketing Communication" (iMAC) that results in zero conversion?Sales Blits activationPromotions Cold calls, warm calls, retention callsEntertainmentThese day’s the terminology of ‘IMAC’ does not happen, and hope new processes systems in the future will help develp this mechanism. Not only the bookers biday, but his family, relatives, frineds etc.The money spend on marketing these days have zero ‘ IMAC’ approach. Just blast, spend money on boosting, without knowing the actual reach, targeted reach of you audience.Hennce, new systems should allow marketing teams to raeach targeted databases, without the hassel of running to eg: Putrajay and assuming they are going to get some businesses from there.Pilot Success: For a Malaysian hotelier, what does a "successful pilot" look like? Is it 7 days of "Interactive AI" data, or is it a specific number of recovered bookings?Interactive data which eases operations, and guarantees customers satisfaction, with positive reviews -  tik tok review etc.The Red Flag: Once a contract is signed, at what month does management usually stop using the tool? What is the "red flag" (e.g., PDPA/data leakage fears) that kills the ROI?Normally the transfer of data from 1 system to another, the integration part is done, then the take over proccess start’s. Main topic here is during the integration process, operations are not affected nor stopped.
